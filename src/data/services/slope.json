      "description": "Approximately 43% of public roadways in the United States remain in poor or mediocre condition, contributing to a massive national maintenance backlog. These deteriorating surfaces don't just damage vehicles; they represent a critical failure in the underlying soil stability that traditional asphalt patches cannot solve. \n\nOur polyurethane injection technology addresses the root of the problem by stabilizing the base and lifting sunken slabs with surgical precision, offering a faster and more cost-effective alternative to full road replacement. By choosing advanced chemical grouting, municipalities and private contractors can directly combat the rising costs of infrastructure decay, ensuring our 4-million-mile road network stays safe and functional for years to come."
