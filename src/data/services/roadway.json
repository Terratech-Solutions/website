As base support continues to weaken, cracking, settlement, and ride-quality issues return, often within the same maintenance cycle.\n\nPolymer injection stabilizes roadways from below by restoring base support and filling subsurface voids without full-depth excavation. This approach extends pavement service life, reduces repeat maintenance cycles, minimizes lane closures and traffic disruption, and lowers total lifecycle cost compared to reconstruction.\n\nBy correcting the root cause of roadway failure, <span class=\"text-true-red underline\">polymer injection provides a durable alternative to continual surface repairs.</span>"
